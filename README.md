# Radial-Basis-Function-Neural-Network

This project includes radial basis function neural network (RBFN) made in Python 3.5.2 and graphical user interface made using Electron technology.

## Getting Started

If you have installed win32 on your system, then its possible to run RBFN.exe from /release-builds/electron-tutorial-app-win32-ia32/. If not, its possible to launch application with ```npm start```.
If you wish to use just the terminal version of neural network, run /RBFN_bash/RadialBasisNN_bash.py.

### Prerequisites

For using RBFN, you need to have installed Python v3 and libraries numpy, sklearn, pandas and matplotlib.

### Installing

Install Python v3, and then install libraries using pip.
```
pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib
```

For using GUI on another OS, install Node.js and then you can start application with
```
npm start
```
