# Radial Basis Function Neural Network

This project includes radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) made in Python 3.5.2 and desktop application made using Electron technology.

## Getting Started

After cloning this repository, start the application.
```
git clone https://github.com/afalak94/Radial-Basis-Function-Neural-Network.git
npm start
```

If you wish to use just the terminal version of neural network, run 
```
python RBFN_bash/RadialBasisNN_bash.py
```

### Prerequisites

For using RBFN, you need to have installed Python v3 and libraries numpy, sklearn, pandas and matplotlib.

### Installing

Install Python v3, and then install libraries using pip.
```
pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib
```

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
